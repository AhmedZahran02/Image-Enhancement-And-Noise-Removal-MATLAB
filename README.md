## **Features**  

### 1. **Image Reading**  
- Supports `.jpg`, `.png`, and `.bmp` image formats.
- Allows users to select an image from their local files.  

---

### 2. **Image Transformations**  
- **RGB to Individual Color Channels:**  
  Extract and visualize the Red, Green, and Blue channels separately.  
- **RGB to HSV Color Space:**  
  Visualize Hue, Saturation, and Value channels.  
- **Grey Scale Conversion:**  
  Convert RGB images to grayscale.  
- **Black & White Conversion:**  
  Convert grayscale images to binary using thresholding.

### 3. **Image Enhancement Techniques**  
- **Brightness Adjustment:** Increase brightness by a scaling factor.  
- **Contrast Enhancement:** Improve contrast using pixel value remapping.  
- **Edge Sharpening:** Apply sharpening filters to enhance image details.  
- **Smoothing:** Reduce noise using Gaussian filtering.  

---

### 4. **Noise Addition**  
Simulate noisy environments by adding different types of noise to the image:  
- **Gaussian Noise**  
- **Poisson Noise**  
- **Salt & Pepper Noise**  
- **Speckle Noise**  

---

### 5. **Noise Removal Techniques**  
- **Gaussian Noise Removal:** Gaussian filter  
- **Poisson Noise Removal:** Lee filter  
- **Salt & Pepper Noise Removal:** Median filter  
- **Speckle Noise Removal:** Combination of Lee filter and median filtering
